# Early Disease Prediction System for Rural Areas

## Project Overview

Timely diagnosis of diseases is often a challenge in rural regions due to limited access to healthcare infrastructure. This project addresses that issue by providing a web-based AI platform where users can input symptoms or basic health information to get early predictions of possible diseases.

The platform uses machine learning to assess risks for common health conditions such as diabetes, anemia, and hypertension. It also provides information about nearby health centers and includes a multilingual interface to support regional users.

The application is built as a full-stack solution with a React frontend, an Express.js backend, and a Flask API for machine learning predictions.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js  
Backend: Node.js with Express  
Machine Learning API: Flask (Python)  
Machine Learning Model: Decision Tree Classifier  
Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend and ML API)  
Version Control: Git and GitHub

## Features

- Symptom input form for AI-based disease prediction
- Machine learning model for predicting risks of common diseases
- Health center suggestion module based on user's location
- Multilingual user interface for broader accessibility
- Responsive design compatible with mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- Modular architecture for ease of scaling and maintenance


## Contribution

This project was developed as part of a team submission for a hackathon/problem statement. All modules were built collaboratively, and responsibilities were distributed among frontend, backend, and ML integration tasks.
